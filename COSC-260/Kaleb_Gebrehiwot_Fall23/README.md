# Road-Trip planner 
As my final project for computer science III, I made a simple road trip planner based on the command line.

## To run:
Compile and run the RoadTripPlanner.java file

## Program flow:
- First you are prompted to enter the list of cities you would like to visit in the midwest(comma separated). You may also enter "List" to get a list of supported cities.
- Then you are presented with prompts for places you would like to visit in the cities you picked.
- Then the program calculates the shortest path along major cities in the mid-west.
- Then you are presented with a route along cities from your initial city to your final destination. Cities you selected to visit will have places you selected to visit listed.
- You will also be presented with estimated milage, travel time, and cost at the footer of the program. Based on $0.655 as the average cost of driving per mile in the US.

I implement the Djkstra's Algorithm to determine the shortest route.
The code is quite unneccesarly convoluted as I was/am still learning to write cleaner code. You are welcome to make/recommend changes you see fit.
